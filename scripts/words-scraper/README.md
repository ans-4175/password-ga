# words-scraper

This folder contains words scrapers, with each file representing one language. The file is named using the lowercase letters of country short codes ([source](https://abbreviations.yourdictionary.com/articles/country-abbreviations.html)).

The idea of making this a folder is so that, if we one day decide to also include other languages, we can create a scraper for that, too. Currently supported language:

- [Indonesian](./id.js)
